Sometimes getting labeled data isn't possible for a given task, or the data you have is not labeled. This is a problem for supervised learning models because they need labeled data in order to make predictions on new data. This is where unsupervised learning saves the day, it can make predictions and build relationships between points without labels. One simple case of unsupervised learning is clustering which takes points and puts them in groups based on distances. The two main forms of clustering is K-Means and Hierarchical Agglomerative (HAC). HAC works by making too many clusters or too few clusters and then changes the number of clusters. K-means makes K groups such that each point is asasigned to their closses group.
