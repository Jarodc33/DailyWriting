Convolutional neural networks are a special kind of network that has multidimensional layers. These networks tend to be good for certain tasks such as image recognition. Layers in a convolutional network can be multidimensional and work to reduce the complexity of image recognition. When an image is put through a normal neural network the number of parameters starts to spiral out of control to billions but with a convolutional neural network it can be done with much less parameters by applying a convolution operation. These layers can be built into a neural network in keras easily by using the layer module in keras ```python layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3))```. The first parameter is the number of filters and the second is the shape of the convolution operation.
